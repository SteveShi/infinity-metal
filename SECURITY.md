## Response Process

- **Acknowledgement**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.

## Mod Safety & Binary Boundary

- **Pointer Safety**: Function hooks into the engine's rendering pipeline validate memory pointers before dereference.
- **Shader Validation**: Metal shaders are pre-compiled and checked for hardware feature limits to avoid GPU hang or system instability.
